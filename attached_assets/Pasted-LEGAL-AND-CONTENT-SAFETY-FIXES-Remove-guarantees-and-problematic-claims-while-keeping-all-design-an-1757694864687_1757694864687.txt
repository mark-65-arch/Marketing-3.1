LEGAL AND CONTENT SAFETY FIXES: Remove guarantees and problematic claims while keeping all design and layout exactly the same.
IMPORTANT: Keep ALL current design, styling, layouts, colors, spacing, and responsive behavior exactly the same. Only change specific text content to avoid legal issues.
1. FIX "WHY HOUSTON SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS" SECTION:
Replace "30-Day Results Guarantee" card with:
"Fast Results Focus"
"Google Business Profile optimization typically shows improvements within 30 days. Most clients see initial results quickly."
2. FIX INDUSTRIES SECTION DESCRIPTIONS:
Auto Repair Shops - Replace:
"Mobile-friendly booking increases conversions 40%+. Show up when people search 'oil change near me' or 'car repair Houston.' Budget: $1,500-$2,500/month, Quick decision makers."
With:
"Mobile-friendly booking can significantly increase conversions. Show up when people search 'oil change near me' or 'car repair Houston.' Quick decision makers who see immediate value."
Cleaning Services - Replace:
"Review generation increases bookings 35%. Service area optimization captures your neighborhoods. Budget: $1,000-$2,000/month, Same-day decisions common."
With:
"Review generation typically increases bookings. Service area optimization captures your neighborhoods. Same-day decisions common."
Remove ALL budget ranges from the other 3 industry descriptions (Independent Contractors, Landscaping, Pet Services). Keep everything else the same but delete the "Budget: X−X-
X−X/month" parts.

3. FIX FAQ SECTION:
Replace this FAQ answer:
"Google Business Profile updates typically show results within 30 days. Most clients see increased calls and form submissions within the first month."
With:
"Google Business Profile improvements often show results within 30-60 days. Most clients see increased visibility and inquiries as optimizations take effect."
4. ADD LEGAL DISCLAIMER:
Add at the bottom of the page, just before the footer:
"Results may vary by business and market conditions. Past performance doesn't guarantee future results."
5. KEEP EVERYTHING ELSE EXACTLY THE SAME:

Don't change any other content
Keep all pricing in "Simple Services" section as-is ($497, $997, $1,497/month)
Preserve all design elements, colors, spacing
Keep navigation, footer, geographic sections unchanged
Maintain all current responsive behavior

RESULT: Legally safer content that removes guarantees and unsubstantiated claims while maintaining marketing effectiveness and professional appearance.
